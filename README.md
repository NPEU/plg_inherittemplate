plg_inherittemplate
===================

New menu items inherit their parent template assignment.

When saving a new menu item, it's often easy to forget to set the template style.
On areas of a website that uses a non-default template style, it's expected that child-pages share the same template style as it's parent by default.

This plugin provides that default behavior. It doesn't alter anything else in Joomla, so the template style can still be changed if neeced.
